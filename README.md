# DelphiDemoTChart
The Code based presented at ADUG Melbourne September 2023

#Sampl Code Only
This is an extract of the code used for the demonstartion at ADUG Melbourne on Monday 19 September 2023

I belive it will compile but it is provided only so participents can access code samples. It is hacked code with lots of redundant routines as things were played with during the development. Each graph form has been a copy of a previous form which was then hacked to present new data

The Compiled Executeable is also provided but unless you have an AGL Data zip or csv file it is unlikely to be able to do much.
